# spectrackularFriends.github.io

Spectra 4.0 hackathon project designed to track mental health, provide resources, and match 
friends during quarantine.

Due to the shelter in place orders and social distancing guidelines, many friends and family
have lost connection. Our web application aims to bridge the gap that has resulted from
extended isolation by providing a space for loved ones to reconnect. Through daily questionnaires
on desired activities and sociability, our app matches its users with friends and family to
encourage connection through watch parties, video calls, and at home workouts with friends. In
order to address rising rates of depression, our application also serves to track mental health
while also providing resources for its users to get the help they need.

Through this process, we learned how to use the Typeform API for retreiving form entries and
experimented with Postman for API testing. In the future, we hope to be able to provide better
analysis of previous user entries and integrate sign-in with popular social media platforms for
importing contacts.
